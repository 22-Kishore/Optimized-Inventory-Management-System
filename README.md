# Optimized-Inventory-Management-System
This project aims to address the challenges associated with inventory management in supply chain operations by integrating advanced algorithms such as Knapsack, Dijkstra, and Hashing. By leveraging these algorithms, the project optimizes stock selection, determines optimal delivery routes, and enhances data retrieval efficiency within the inventory management system.

Functionalities
Inventory Optimization
Utilizes the Knapsack algorithm to intelligently select the most valuable items for shipping while adhering to weight constraints.
Ensures efficient allocation of resources and maximizes profitability in inventory distribution.
Route Optimization
Employs Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest delivery routes, minimizing transportation time and costs.
Enhances logistics efficiency by minimizing travel distances.
Data Retrieval Efficiency
Implements Hashing techniques to enhance data retrieval efficiency, facilitating rapid inventory tracking and management.
Enables quick access to inventory information, leading to improved decision-making and operational responsiveness.
Algorithms/Concepts Used
Knapsack Algorithm
Dynamic programming technique used to optimize stock selection for shipping based on value-to-weight ratios.
Maximizes the value of items selected within weight constraints.
Dijkstra's Algorithm
Graph search algorithm utilized for determining the shortest path between nodes in a graph.
Computes the shortest distances between inventory locations to optimize delivery routes.
Hashing Techniques
Involves the use of hash functions to map data to unique identifiers or keys.
Enhances data retrieval efficiency within the inventory management system.
